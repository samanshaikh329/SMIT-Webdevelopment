    <h1> <i> Cinderella Story</i></h1>

    <p><b>Cinderella</b> is a kind girl forced into servitude by her cruel
     stepmother and stepsisters, who call her <b> "Cinderella" </b> because
     she's always covered in soot; a royal ball offers hope, but they
     prevent her from going, until her fairy godmother magically
     provides a gown, carriage, and glass slippers, warning her to
     return by midnight. <br> At the ball, she captivates the Prince,
     but flees at midnight, losing a slipper; the Prince uses it to 
     find her, it fits perfectly, and they marry, living happily ever 
     after. </p><hr>
